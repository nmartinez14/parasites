# parasites
Analysis for understanding how natural diversity gradients influence parasite 
prevalence in bees.

## Repository organization  

packages.sh  
- This shell script includes code to install all of the required R packages to 
run analysis and figure-generating scripts. 

parasitesData.Rdata  
- This Rdata file includes all of the necessary pieces of data to run the 
scripts in this repository. These include:
  - spec.net  
    - This data frame includes all of the specimen-level data and relevant 
    explanatory variables for all analyses. 
  - phylo_matrix  
    - This matrix array is the phylogenetic covariance matrix of bee species 
    included in this manuscript. The original published supermatrix was 
    downloaded and trimmed using our species list.

    )  
  - sites_sf  
    - This sf spatial object includes spatial data from our sites used for 
    generating the map figure.  
  
analysis  
  - This folder includes the scripts to run the two main analyses for 
  this manuscript, including:  
    - SEM  
      - 1_amplification_dilution.R  
        - This script runs the structural equation modeling script for each 
        host genus and parasite.
      - 2_Plotting_SEM.R  
        - This script creates the scatterplots for the results from the parasite
        prevalence models of the SEM.
      - 3_Plotting_Community.R  
        - This script creates the scatterplots for the results from the 
        community models portion of the SEM.
    
figures  
  - This folder includes the scripts to generate the site map.  

## To use this repository  
  The R scripts in the analysis folder should be run in order 
(i.e., 0, 1, 2) to reproduce the analyses and figures. All analyses were run 
using R (version 4.4.1).
